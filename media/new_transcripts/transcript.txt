 How may I help you? I'm here because I've been having some pain in my left knee for the past two months and it's not getting better. It feels stiff and I just haven't been able to, you know, use it as well as I was using it before and it's just limited some of my daily activities. Okay. And where, so the pain is in your left knee, where are you feeling the pain specifically? It isn't at the front of the knee, the sides or the back. Could you point to it? It feels like it's mostly on the front. Okay. Like deep within that kneecap. Okay. And you said the pain started two months ago? Yes. Well, it's always been a little like tender, but now it's more painful. Okay. And so, so has it been getting worse? I would say so slowly getting worse. Okay. And when you get pain in the left knee, how long does it typically last for? It usually hurts while I'm doing, like while I'm moving it or just after, but if I, if I rest, the pain eventually goes away. But when I first wake up in the morning, that joint feels stiff. And then when I start using it, I'm using it more, it's less stiff, but it becomes painful. Okay. So you have some stiffness in the morning? I do. Okay.
